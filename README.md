Dataset : We have more than 160k songs from the Spotify Web API from year 1920-2020. The dataset lists features like danceability, acousticness, loudness etc. for different songs along with their release year and popularity.

Business Problem : Since the feature trends for songs are changing overtime, we have tried analysing these trends. We predict popularity for the new songs based on these feature importances. It would help to figure out how a song would do when it hits the market and help musicians figure out the what kind of songs people stream most. Further, it can also be used to make content based recommender systems where songs can be clustered according to patterns in their audio features.

Machine Learning Problem : We have popularity range from 1-100. We will bin it into 10 categories and solve it as a multi-class classification problem. Then we cluster songs using clustering techniques to figure out the categories that have similar characteristics and can be used for recommendation systems.
